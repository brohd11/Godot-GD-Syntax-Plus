# GDScript Syntax Plus

I wanted to create this plugin to make working with preloaded classes easier. This is something that is done alot when working with plugins.

Const and vars named with a capital letter can be highlighted in a chosen color.

Const written in all caps van be highlighted as well.

You can also define tags like: "#>MyTag", as well as choosing which variable type it will apply to.
Placeing this at the end of the line, will cause every instance of that word to be highlighted in the script.

Note there is no scope checking. If you have a shadowed variable it will be highlighted as well.

Context menu entries are added to lines that have a valid keyword for your tags.

Use the config window under Project -> Tools to set the desired tags, keywords and colors.
